# ðŸ“š High Performance PostgreSQL for Rails
Rideshare is the Rails application for the book ["High Performance PostgreSQL for Rails"](https://pragprog.com/titles/aapsql/high-performance-postgresql-for-rails), published by Pragmatic Programmers in 2024.

# Installation
Prepare your development machine.

## Homebrew Packages
First, install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh).

### Graphviz
```sh
brew install graphviz
```

## Ruby Version Manager
Before installing Ruby, install a *Ruby version manager*. The recommended one is [Rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv). Run:

```sh
brew install rbenv
```

## PostgreSQL
PostgreSQL 16 or greater is required. Installation may be via Homebrew, although the recommended method is [Postgres.app](https://postgresapp.com)

### PostgresApp
- Once installed, from the Menu Bar app, choose "Open Postgres" then click the "+" icon to create a new PostgreSQL 16 server


## Ruby
Run `cat .ruby-version` from the Rideshare directory to find the needed version of Ruby.

For example, if `3.2.2` is listed, run:

```sh
rbenv install 3.2.2
```

Run `rbenv versions` to confirm the correct version is active. The current version has an asterisk.

```sh
  system
* 3.2.2 (set by /Users/andy/Projects/rideshare/.ruby-version)
```

Running into rbenv trouble? Review *Learn how to load rbenv in your shell* using [`rbenv init`](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv).

## Bundler and Gems
Bundler is included when you install Ruby using Rbenv. You're ready to install the Ruby gems for Rideshare.

Run the following command from the Rideshare directory:

```sh
bundle install
```

## Rideshare development database
Normally in Ruby on Rails applications, you'd run `bin/rails db:create` to create the dev and test databases. Rideshare uses a custom script.

The script is [`db/setup.sh`](db/setup.sh). Don't run it yet.

Before you run it, make sure the following environment variable is set:

- `RIDESHARE_DB_PASSWORD`

To do so, run `echo $RIDESHARE_DB_PASSWORD` to check if you've already set a value.

If it's empty, generate a password and set it as the value for `RIDESHARE_DB_PASSWORD`.

```sh
export RIDESHARE_DB_PASSWORD=$(openssl rand -hex 12)
```

Once both are set, run the script using the command below. This method writes script output into the `output.log` file.

```sh
sh db/setup.sh 2>&1 | tee -a output.log
```

Finally, as suggested by the notes output at the end of the setup script, run `export DATABASE_URL=<value from .env>` to set the value of the `DATABASE_URL`. The value is in `.env`, and is also output at the end of the setup script.

Confirm that's a non-empty value by running `echo $DATABASE_URL`.

Once `DATABASE_URL` is set, we'll use it as an argument to `psql` to connect to the database. Run `psql $DATABASE_URL` to do that.

Once connected, you're good to go. If you'd like to do more checks, expand the checks and run through them below.

<details open>

<summary>Installation Checks</summary>

From within psql, run this:

```sql
SELECT current_user;
```

Confirm user `owner` is displayed.

```sql
owner@localhost:5432 rideshare_development# select current_user;
 current_user
 --------------
  owner
```

From psql, run the *describe namespace* meta-command:

```sql
\dn
```

Verify the `rideshare` schema is displayed.

```sql
owner@localhost:5432 rideshare_development# \dn
  List of schemas
   Name    | Owner
-----------+-------
 rideshare | owner
```

Run the *describe table* meta command next: `\dt`. Rideshare tables like `users`, `trips` and others should be listed.

If no tables are listed, make sure you've run migrations, see below!
</details>


## Run Migrations
Run migrations the standard way:

```sh
bin/rails db:migrate
```

Note that migrations are preceded by the command `SET role = owner`, so they're run with `owner` as the owner of database objects.

See `lib/tasks/migration_hooks.rake` for more details.

If migrations ran successfully, you're good to go!

# Development Guides and Documentation

## Troubleshooting

The Rideshare repository has many `README.md` files within subdirectories. Run `find . -name 'README.md'` to see them all.

- For DB things: [db/README.md](db/README.md)
- For database scripts: [db/scripts/README.md](db/scripts/README.md)
- For PostgreSQL things: [postgresql/README.md](postgresql/README.md)

# UI

Although Rideshare is an *API-only* app, there are some UI elements.

Rideshare runs [PgHero](https://github.com/ankane/pghero) which has a UI.

Connect to it:

```sh
bin/rails server
```

Once that's running, visit <http://localhost:3000/pghero> in your browser to see it.
